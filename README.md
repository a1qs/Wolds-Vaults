Wold's Vaults is a highly customized version of the popular Vault Hunters 3 for Minecraft 1.18.2. The project consists of this (the main pack itself) and the [official mod](https://onedev.iwolfking.xyz/Wolds-Vaults/WoldsVaultOfficialMod) which handles a lot of the new items, blocks, objectives, bug fixes, and other features of the pack.

Wold's has been in development for over half a year now! Crazy how time flies...


### Contribution Guide
Ever had something you wished was in Vault Hunters 3, or you love playing Wold's but there's an issue or addition that just needs it's itch scratched? I'd be happy to accept any contributions, here's a little guide that should get you started:

1. Create a OneDev account on my instance here so you can open issues. 

2. Open an Issue under this Project (not the official mod) with a Type of "Access Request" and let me know what you are looking to do and why you are wanting to contribute. I will come by and respond to you and give you appropriate access to projects.

3. Once you have access, depending on your access, you should be able to pick up and open issues, and are able to submit pull requests.

4. Please do all your changes on a separate branch, (for example I am currently working on the 0.10.0-iwk branch myself), and then submit a pull request to merge your changes into the correct branch, usually the current version feature branch (0.10.0). I will handle merges into the master branches. I will review your changes and approve or comment as necessary.

5. Thanks and enjoy Wold's Vaults!
